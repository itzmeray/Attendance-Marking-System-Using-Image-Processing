## ✅ Project Overview

This mini project titled **“Attendance Marking System Using Image Processing”** is designed to automate the student attendance process by utilizing facial recognition. The system captures the face of a student through a webcam, processes it using image recognition algorithms, and then marks the attendance in a `.csv` file along with the timestamp. It also gives **voice feedback** for real-time interaction and confirmation.

This project was successfully completed as part of the academic curriculum for the partial fulfillment of the Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science and Engineering under VTU, Belagavi.
